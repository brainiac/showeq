ShowEQ v5.x
-----------
Realtime packet analyzer for Everquest

DESCRIPTION
-----------
ShowEQ sits passively and waits for Everquest packets to pass by
on the ethernet card. It rebuilds the data stream and displays
useful information about the data being sent between client and
server.

ShowEQ is free software, distributed under the terms of the [GNU]
General Public License, version 2.  For more information, see the
file COPYING.

Please read the ChangeLog and NEWS files for more information.

INSTALLATION
------------
See the file 'INSTALL' for installation and configuration information.
For people new to ShowEQ and to linux see INSTALL.newbies.
Maps for use in ShowEQ can be found in the showeq-maps tarball.

RUNNING
-------
ShowEQ needs to have root access to be able to receive the packets,
so make sure you run it as root.

Usage:
  ./showeq --help

shows current command line arguments.  Also look at the 
conf/seqdef.xml file for configuration file options and defaults.
Most configuration changes can be done via the user interface.
